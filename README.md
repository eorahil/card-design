This C# tool can be used to design cards. The initial target is the Arkham Horror LCG Game but it will be redesignable for any other card game.

It's divided in 3 parts:

** One or more designs for an specific game
** Types of cards and what is the structure of each type

* Cards design

** With a fixed structure created in the CSD, create a set of cards
